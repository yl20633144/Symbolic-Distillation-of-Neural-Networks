# Project

This repository is for the submission of your Project for the MPhil in Data Intensive Science. Place all of your code, and your report, into this repository. The report should be in pdf format, and placed in a folder named `report`. You have been given access to this repository with the role `maintainer` which will expire on:

**23:59 Sunday the 30th of June**

which is the submission deadline for this work. After this date we will assess whatever the repository contains at that time. You are expected to submit code and associated material that demonstrates good software development practices as covered in the C1 Research Computing module. This should be accompanied by a report of **not more than 7,000 words** describing the project and its development, and an executive summary of **not more than 1000 words** as a separate document. 

You are reminded to comply with the requirements given in the Course Handbook regarding the use of, and declaration of use of, autogeneration tools. Word counts should include tables, figure captions and appendices but exclude references and your declaration of use of autogeneration tools; please indicate its word count on its front cover.  

**Failure to include the wordcount and declarations of use of autogeneration tools will result in automatic loss of marks.**
